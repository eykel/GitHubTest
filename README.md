# GitHubTest

Let's talk about things that you gonna see here.

--MVVM
--Coroutines
--Retrofit
--Room
--BubbleShowCase
--Koin
--Lottie

Well, we did here a short implementation of part of github api. 
Here you can search by nickname, location or language.
The app is based in MVVM architecture, with repository. Using Room to persist data on local and using coroutines + retrofit to fetch data from server.
Here we are using Koin, to manager our dependecy injection and to guide user on the first access, BubbleShowCase to create a nice first show case.
Finally, to make it cool, a short implementation of lottier, the Airbnb lib to run animations from json.
